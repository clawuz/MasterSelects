# 3D Layer System

MasterSelects authorable 3D content now resolves through one shared scene contract.

- The native WebGPU scene is the primary runtime for 3D planes, primitive meshes, 3D text, imported OBJ/glTF/GLB models, camera clips, and native gaussian-splat scene objects.
- Gaussian splat clips render through the native WebGPU scene path and stay inside the same scene camera, object-transform, and effector contract as the rest of the 3D system.
- The old `three.js` bridge has been removed. Native shared-scene rendering is the only active 3D runtime.

Legacy gaussian-avatar support still exists in code for migration and old project data, but new avatar import is disabled.

## Surface Status

| Surface | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Per-layer 3D toggle | Stable | Any normal video/image layer can be switched between 2D and 3D. |
| 3D video/image planes | Stable | `clip.is3D` video and image layers render as scene planes. |
| OBJ / glTF / GLB model import | Stable | Model clips are always 3D and render as shared-scene objects. |
| Primitive mesh clips | Stable | Cube, sphere, plane, cylinder, torus, cone, and 3D text render through the native shared scene. |
| Scene camera clips | Stable | Timeline camera clips drive preview and export scene navigation. |
| Gaussian splat clips | Stable | They render as normal shared-scene objects under the native WebGPU path. |
| Splat effector clips | Stable but specialized | They deform scene-driven splats live at playback time; 3D planes remain excluded in phase 1. |
| Gaussian avatar import | Legacy only | Import is blocked; existing projects may still expose blendshape editing. |
| Temporal / particle splat settings | Experimental | Wired in the engine/export path, but not yet exposed as a dedicated properties tab. |

## Rendering Model

```text
[2D layers] --------------------------------> Existing WebGPU compositor
        |
        +--> [3D planes / meshes / text / models / splats / cameras]
                   -> Scene layer collection
                   -> Shared scene camera resolution
                   -> NativeSceneRenderer
                   -> one synthetic 3D scene texture
                   -> compositor
```

Prepared splat runtime metadata, native splat rasterization, preview, nested compositions, preload, readiness, and export now all converge on the same scene-layer and scene-camera contract.

## Stable 3D Features

### Per-Layer 3D Toggle

- Any video or image clip can be toggled to 3D from the Transform panel.
- 3D layers become textured planes in the common 3D scene.
- Video and image clips that still use the default `position.z = 0` start slightly behind the scene target when first toggled to 3D, so a full-frame plane does not depth-mask splats or meshes.
- While scrubbing, 3D video planes keep their last uploaded texture if the browser video element is briefly between decoded frames, avoiding full shared-scene flicker.
- Turning 3D off resets the 3D-specific transform state back to 2D defaults.

### 3D Model Import

- Supported import formats are `.obj`, `.gltf`, and `.glb`.
- Model clips are automatically marked `is3D: true` and cannot be switched back to 2D.
- Models are auto-centered and normalized to fit the viewport.
- glTF / GLB base color textures are loaded from data URIs, external image URIs, or embedded bufferViews when `baseColorTexture` and `TEXCOORD_0` are present.
- Textured glTF / GLB materials render unlit in the native pass, matching scan/photogrammetry assets better than the simple fallback directional light.
- GLB sequences normalize every frame against the first renderable frame's bounds and preload nearby playback frames, avoiding per-frame center/scale jumps and visible current-frame loading flicker.
- GLB sequences imported into an open project are copied to `Raw/<sequence-name>/` using the original frame names; existing same-size frame files are reused instead of written again.
- Untextured models use ambient plus directional fallback lighting.
- The Transform panel exposes a wireframe debug toggle for model clips.
- Imported models use a native runtime/cache path.

### Primitive Meshes and 3D Text

Create mesh clips from the Media Panel via `+ Add > Mesh` or the context menu:

| Primitive | Geometry | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cube | `BoxGeometry` | Default 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 |
| Sphere | `SphereGeometry` | Default radius 0.35 |
| Plane | `PlaneGeometry` | Default 0.8 x 0.8 |
| Cylinder | `CylinderGeometry` | Default radius 0.25, height 0.6 |
| Torus | `TorusGeometry` | Default radius 0.3, tube 0.1 |
| Cone | `ConeGeometry` | Default radius 0.3, height 0.6 |
| 3D Text | `text3d` mesh type | Editable text geometry with font, bevel, spacing, and scale controls |

- Mesh items live in a `Meshes` folder in the Media Panel.
- Dragging a mesh item to the timeline creates a 3D clip with `is3D: true` and `meshType`.
- All transform properties and keyframe animation are supported.
- Primitive meshes and 3D text render through the native shared scene contract.

### Preview Scene Gizmo

- Selected scene objects expose a viewport transform gizmo for Move, Rotate, and Scale.
- Move, Rotate, and Scale visuals are drawn by the native WebGPU scene gizmo pass from the selected object's local transform basis. The React overlay only supplies hit targets and the mode toolbar.
  - Move and Scale use larger Unreal-style colored local-axis handles with dark outlines and a white center hub. Hovering an axis brightens and thickens that native gizmo handle. Dragging the center hub moves freely in the preview plane for Move and applies proportional uniform scale for Scale.
- Rotate mode draws larger screen-space stable colored rings from the X, Y, and Z local rotation planes, so the ring orientation changes with object rotation and the scene view without the rings visually growing or shrinking. The invisible SVG hit targets are generated from the same projected 3D ring points, and hover/drag chooses the nearest ring instead of whichever SVG stroke is visually on top.
- Rotation dragging follows the selected projected local ring and applies the delta as a local-axis rotation before converting back to Euler transform values. This keeps red, green, and blue controls aligned with the visual local gizmo even after the object is already rotated.
- Double-clicking an axis resets that single component, while double-clicking the white center hub resets the active transform group.
- The W/E/R hotkeys switch between Move, Rotate, and Scale while the preview overlay is active.
- 3D object handles remain visible and selectable in normal preview, layer Edit mode, camera Edit mode, and camera orthographic edit views. Clicking a handle selects that clip and activates the native scene gizmo for the selected 3D object.

### Scene Camera

There are two camera concepts in the product:

- Composition camera: project-level camera settings on the composition itself.
- Camera clips: timeline clips that drive the active shared scene camera.

Camera clips expose camera settings inside the Transform tab:

- FOV with editable full-frame-equivalent focal length in millimeters
- Near plane
- Far plane
- Resolution X/Y for the camera gate aspect
- Position X/Y/Z as camera placement controls that stay independent from lens FOV/mm

The Transform tab becomes scene-navigation controls for the active camera clip. In FPS mode, the preview accepts WASD/QE navigation plus uncapped mouse look. Free scene navigation now belongs to camera clips rather than gaussian-splat clips.
Lens controls change the projection/FOV without rewriting camera position fields. Camera Position X/Y/Z is the real camera eye position in world space. The camera Edit view draws the timeline-camera frame from FOV/mm and Resolution X/Y, so the front frame grows for wider lenses, shrinks for tele lenses, and follows the configured gate aspect. The preview wheel in Scene Nav moves that camera position along the current view direction and does not edit `camera.fov` or the full-frame-equivalent mm field. The old camera `scale.all` Zoom and Distance controls are hidden from the camera UI to avoid a second focal-length-like orbit-rig surface next to camera Position/Rotation.

When Edit mode is enabled while the playhead is over a camera clip, the preview switches to a temporary edit-view camera with its own 35 mm default lens, independent from the timeline camera's lens. Orbiting, panning, and zooming this view does not write transform changes back to the real camera clip; entering and leaving Edit mode blends between the edit-view camera and the timeline camera. In that edit-view, shortcuts `1`, `2`, and `3` animate to orthographic Front, Side, and Top views, and `4` animates back to the normal edit-view camera. Edit views draw a projected Blender-style world grid that animates with the camera view instead of snapping as a screen overlay: Front uses XY at `z=0`, Side uses YZ at `x=0`, and Top/free camera uses XZ at `y=0`. In the camera edit views, wheel zoom and Shift-drag/MMB/RMB pan only move the temporary viewport, regular 3D object handles stay visible and selectable, and selecting a non-camera 3D object activates the same native scene gizmo used by the normal preview. Double-clicking a non-camera 3D object handle in camera Edit mode retargets the temporary orbit pivot to that object, so subsequent free-camera orbiting rotates around it. Right-clicking a non-camera object handle or its selected gizmo opens a small menu with `Set Orbit Pivot` for the same retarget action. The real timeline camera is drawn as a small projected camera wireframe with a direction/frustum indicator. The full viewport gizmo appears only when that camera clip is selected in the normal edit-view camera, and explicit gizmo drags still edit the camera clip through the normal transform/keyframe path. Camera clips do not show a viewport gizmo in the normal view. The 2D layer bounding-box editor is only active in Edit mode when no camera clip is active at the playhead.

Camera rotation keyframes interpolate through the shortest angular path so timeline flights do not spin the long way around when yaw, pitch, or roll crosses a 360-degree wrap. Camera Position X/Y/Z and rotation keyframes render through world-pose interpolation: the camera eye and target are interpolated between keyed world poses, while legacy camera scale keyframes are ignored by the camera pose.

## Gaussian Splats

Gaussian splat clips are imported through the SuperSplat-compatible `@playcanvas/splat-transform` reader path. Supported scene formats include `.ply`, `.compressed.ply`, `.splat`, `.ksplat`, `.spz`, `.sog`, `.lcc`, and zipped SOG-style `.zip` payloads. Plain point-cloud PLY files without gaussian scale properties fall back to the local point-cloud conversion path.

- Clips are created as `is3D: true`.
- The Gaussian tab exposes the native renderer status together with `maxSplats`, `sortFrequency`, `splatScale`, `orientationPreset`, `nearPlane`, and `farPlane`.
- Gaussian splats participate in scene cameras, object transforms, object-level effectors, preview, nested compositions, export, preload, and readiness checks through the same native shared-scene path.
- Realtime splat rendering uses a worker-backed back-to-front order buffer based on the SuperSplat/PlayCanvas sorter approach. Precise export can still fall back to the existing GPU sort path.
- Sequence splats follow the same shared runtime contract and preload nearby frames without replacing foreground playback with repeated loading overlays.
- PLY/splat sequences imported into an open project are copied to `Raw/<sequence-name>/` using the original frame names; existing same-size frame files are reused instead of written again.
- Imported splats and numbered splat sequences store media-panel stats: container label, file size, per-frame splat count, and total sequence splat count.
- The Transform tab now exposes normal object transforms for gaussian splats. Scene navigation lives on camera clips.
- Large gaussian splats show viewport loading progress during project restore, URL fetch, parser work, normalization, and GPU upload.

Some gaussian-splat settings exist in the data model and export pipeline but are not yet surfaced as a full dedicated UI:

- `backgroundColor`
- temporal playback settings
- particle effect settings

Those are wired through the renderer and export code, but they should still be treated as in-progress surface area.

## Splat Effectors

Splat effector clips are timeline clips that affect scene-driven splats, including native gaussian-splat clips.

- Modes: `repel`, `attract`, `swirl`, and `noise`
- Controls: strength, falloff, speed, and seed
- Transform scale acts as the effector radius
- They do not render visible content on their own
- 3D planes remain excluded in phase 1 for parity with older projects

This is a specialized 3D feature that is stable in the UI and now follows the shared scene contract.

## Legacy Gaussian Avatars

Gaussian avatar import is now legacy-only:

- The import action is blocked in the current product surface.
- Existing projects can still carry legacy avatar clips.
- The Blendshapes tab remains available for those legacy clips.
- New work should use gaussian-splat clips instead.

If you see avatar-specific code paths in the renderer or AI tooling, treat them as migration/reference code rather than the recommended authoring path.

## Properties Tabs

| Clip type | Visible tabs |
|---|---|
| Regular 2D clip | Transform, Effects, Masks, Transcript, Analysis |
| Camera clip | Transform |
| Gaussian splat clip | Transform, Gaussian, Effects, Masks, Transcript, Analysis |
| Splat effector clip | Transform, Effector, Effects, Masks, Transcript, Analysis |
| 3D text clip | 3D Text, Transform, Effects, Masks |
| Legacy gaussian avatar clip | Transform, Blendshapes |

The Transform tab is context-sensitive:

- For normal 3D layers, it shows position, scale, rotation, opacity, blend mode, and 3D toggles. Scale All is stored as `scale.all` and multiplies X/Y/Z at render time, so uniform scale and axis scale can be animated independently.
- 3D object position fields use scene units. Regular 2D clips still display composition pixel units.
- For camera clips, it becomes scene-navigation and lens controls.
- For gaussian splats, it now behaves like a normal 3D object transform surface plus 3D effector toggle.
- The `Speed` field is explicitly marked WIP in the UI.

## Export

3D layers are included in export.

- Scene camera resolution, scene-layer collection, splat runtime preparation, preload, and readiness now share the same scene contract across preview, nested, and export.
- Gaussian splats can export through prepared or direct native scene modes while keeping identical scene-camera semantics.
- Export waits for shared 3D and splat readiness before capture so preview and export stay aligned.
